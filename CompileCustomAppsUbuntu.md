# Build Custom C++/SIMCA-Q Applications in Ubuntu with GNU tools

## Getting ready

In */usr/share/libsimcaq/examples/* you find examples of SIMC-Q applications with files that you can use as templates. Among them, we suggest that you copy *acinclude.m4* to the folder of your source code.
*acinclude.m4* contains macros needed for linking SIMCA-Q libraries.
